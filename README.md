## Description

KapiPostsList is an app that uses the API to fetch and display a list of posts. The app is built with Kotlin, MVVM architecture, Hilt dependency injection, Jetpack Compose UI, and Retrofit networking library.
The app demonstrates how to use modern Android development tools and best practices to create a simple but functional app.

The app has two screens: a list screen and a form screen. The list screen displays the posts from the selected layout. The user can scroll down to load more posts, or swipe down to refresh the list.
The user can also tap on a post to view its details, such as the title and body. The form screen allows the user to enter a new title and body for a post, and submit it to the current list. 
The new post is then added to the list and displayed on the list screen.
